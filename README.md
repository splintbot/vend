Installation
You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). I recommend using the latest LTS version.

To create a new app, you have to:


Clone the repository:

"git clone https://github.com/splintbot/vend.git"

Entre the app:
"cd vend"


type "yarn" to install dependencies in package.json file


type "yarn start" to start the app 
app should start on http://localhost:3000
